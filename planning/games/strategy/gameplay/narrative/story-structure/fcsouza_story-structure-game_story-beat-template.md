## Pacing Guidelines

- **Act 1** (~25%): Setup, introduce characters, establish stakes, first player choice
- **Act 2** (~50%): Escalation, complications, major choices, midpoint twist
- **Act 3** (~25%): Climax, resolution, consequences of choices realized
- Space high-tension beats with quieter moments for pacing
- Each act should have at least one significant player choice
- Track cumulative playtime per beat to ensure pacing targets

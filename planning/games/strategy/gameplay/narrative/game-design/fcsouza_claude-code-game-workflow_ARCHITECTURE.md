## Reading Order for New Projects

```
1. claude-code-game-workflow     (understand the skill ecosystem)
2. game-design-fundamentals      (define your game's core loop)
3. worldbuilding                 (establish the world)
4. game-backend-architecture     (set up the server)
5. postgres-game-schema          (define the data model)
6. redis-game-patterns           (set up caching and pub/sub)
7. betterauth-integration        (add authentication)
8. ... (remaining skills as needed)
```

## Foundational Skills (No Prerequisites)

These four skills are entry points — read them first in their respective domains:

- **Engineering**: `game-backend-architecture`
- **Design**: `game-design-fundamentals`
- **Narrative**: `worldbuilding`
- **Infrastructure**: `claude-code-game-workflow`

## Cross-Domain Bridges

Some skills bridge multiple domains:

| Bridge | From | To | Why |
|--------|------|-----|-----|
| quest-mission-design | Design | Engineering + Narrative | Quests need DB schema and narrative coherence |
| game-economy-design | Design | Engineering | Economy needs DB tables and payment integration |
| stripe-game-payments | Engineering | Design | Payment SKUs come from economy design |
| monitoring-game-ops | Infrastructure | Engineering | Monitors the game server and queues |

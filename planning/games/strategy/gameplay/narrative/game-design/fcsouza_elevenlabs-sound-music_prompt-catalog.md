## ElevenLabs — Voice Lines

### Narrator
- "Deep, authoritative male voice. Calm and measured pacing. Slight echo suggesting a large space. Read as if recounting ancient history."
- "Warm female voice with gentle cadence. Encouraging tone. Read as tutorial guidance for a new player."

### NPC Dialogue
- "[Character name] voice: [age] [gender], [accent/quality]. Emotional state: [emotion]. Context: [situation]."
- Example: "Merchant voice: middle-aged male, jovial and slightly raspy. Emotional state: welcoming. Context: greeting a customer."

### Combat Callouts
- "Short, sharp exclamation. [Gender] voice, strained with effort. One word or short phrase. Context: attacking."
- "Pained grunt. [Gender] voice. Brief, involuntary sound. Context: taking damage."

### System / Tutorial
- "Clear, neutral voice. Professional tone. No emotion. Read as UI system notification."
- "Friendly, upbeat voice. Encouraging. Read as achievement unlock announcement."

## ElevenLabs — Sound Effects

### UI Sounds
- "Soft click sound, like tapping a glass button. Short, clean, satisfying."
- "Whoosh transition sound, left to right, 0.3 seconds. Smooth, digital."
- "Notification chime. Two ascending tones, pleasant, not alarming. 0.5 seconds."
- "Error buzz. Low, brief, clearly indicates failure without being harsh."

### Action Sounds
- "Impact sound. Solid hit, medium force. No specific weapon — abstract physical contact."
- "Energy release sound. Bright, crackling, building to a burst. 1 second."
- "Collect/pickup sound. Bright, ascending sparkle. Short and satisfying. 0.3 seconds."

### Ambient Loops
- "Gentle wind through an open space. Occasional distant sounds. Calm, continuous loop."
- "Interior room tone. Quiet hum, distant muffled activity. Warm and enclosed."
- "Crowd ambiance. Multiple voices in background, indistinct. Lively but not overwhelming."

## Seed Management

Save seeds for reproducibility:
```json
{
  "trackId": "combat_01",
  "provider": "elevenlabs-music",
  "prompt": "Intense battle music, 150 BPM in D minor, instrumental only",
  "musicLengthMs": 60000,
  "generatedAt": "2026-03-01"
}
```

For Lyria tracks, also record `seed`, `negativePrompt`, and `model` fields.

- Same seed + same prompt = similar output
- Use different seeds per context for variety
- Store accepted seeds in a manifest file for regeneration

# Quest & Mission Design

## Purpose

Quest types, objective trees, reward structures, and mission flow design for any game genre. Enforces narrative coherence through mandatory lore checks.

## When to Use

Trigger: quest design, mission design, objectives, quest types, quest rewards, quest tree, mission flow, side quests, main quest, quest chain, objective design

## Prerequisites

- `quest-narrative-coherence` — **MANDATORY**. Read and follow the 5-step coherence check before creating ANY quest.
- `game-design-fundamentals` — core loop and reward system knowledge
- `worldbuilding` — world context for quest setting

## Core Principles

> Jonathan Blow: "Every puzzle should feel like a genuine insight, not busywork."
> Sid Meier: "A game is a series of interesting decisions."
> Hidetaka Miyazaki: "Quests should reveal the world, not just provide objectives."

1. **Every quest must pass the coherence check** — no orphan quests, no lore contradictions (see `quest-narrative-coherence`)
2. **Objectives must present meaningful choices** — not just "go here, collect that" (Sid Meier)
3. **Quest rewards must match the game economy** — cross-reference `game-economy-design` for balance
4. **Multi-path solutions** — at least 2 ways to complete any significant quest (Jonathan Blow)
5. **Quests reveal world** — every quest should teach the player something about the world (Miyazaki)
6. **Pacing matches the game** — quest length and density fit the session cadence from `game-design-fundamentals`
7. **No fetch quests without narrative purpose** — if a quest is mechanically simple, it must be narratively rich

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Run Coherence Check
Follow the 5-step check from `quest-narrative-coherence`. Load lore, check registry, validate, reference existing content, register.

### 2. Define Quest Type
Choose from the quest type taxonomy (see below).

### 3. Design Objective Tree
Map out the objectives, branching paths, and completion conditions.

### 4. Balance Rewards
Cross-reference `game-economy-design` for appropriate reward scale.

### 5. Write Quest Brief
Use the quest template in `templates/`.

### 6. Register Quest
Add to quest-registry.md per the coherence clause.

## Quest Type Taxonomy

| Type | Description | Example (abstract) |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Main Story | Advances primary narrative arc | "Uncover the truth about [event]" |
| Side Quest | Optional, enriches world | "Help [NPC] with [problem]" |
| Chain Quest | Multi-step, each unlocks next | "Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3" |
| Branching | Player choice determines outcome | "Side with [A] or [B]" |
| Repeatable | Can be done multiple times | "Daily challenge: [task]" |
| Discovery | Triggered by exploration | "Find [hidden thing] to unlock" |
| Social | Requires other players | "Complete [task] with a group" |
| Timed | Must complete within deadline | "Finish before [timer] expires" |
| Collection | Gather a set of items/objects | "Find all [N] pieces of [set]" |
| Escort/Protect | Keep something safe | "Protect [target] during [event]" |

## Objective Tree Structure

```
Quest: [Name]
├── Objective 1: [Required]
│   ├── Sub-objective 1a: [Required]
│   └── Sub-objective 1b: [Optional bonus]
├── Objective 2: [Choice A OR Choice B]
│   ├── Choice A: [Path with consequence X]
│   └── Choice B: [Path with consequence Y]
└── Objective 3: [Final — depends on choice above]
    ├── Outcome A: [If chose A above]
    └── Outcome B: [If chose B above]
```

## Cross-References

- `quest-narrative-coherence` — MANDATORY prerequisite
- `worldbuilding` — world context for quest setting
- `game-economy-design` — reward balancing
- `game-design-fundamentals` — core loop integration
- `character-design-narrative` — NPC involvement
- `postgres-game-schema` — quest data persistence

## Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

- **"Go collect 10 things"** — collection quests without narrative justification
- **"Orphan quest"** — quest that connects to nothing in the world (caught by coherence check)
- **"Reward inflation"** — quest gives too much, breaking economy
- **"One true path"** — quest with only one solution removes player agency
- **"Lore dump quest"** — NPC talks for 5 minutes, player does nothing
- **"Invisible prerequisite"** — quest requires something the player can't know about

## Designer Philosophy

**Jonathan Blow** (Braid, The Witness): Every quest objective should feel like a genuine insight. If the player is just following a marker, the quest has failed. The best quests make players think, experiment, and discover.

**Sid Meier** (Civilization): Quests are decisions. "Go kill X" is not a decision. "Choose between helping faction A (gaining their trust but angering B) or helping faction B" IS a decision.

**Hidetaka Miyazaki** (Dark Souls, Elden Ring): The best quests don't announce themselves. They emerge from exploration, environmental clues, and NPC conversations. The player should feel like they discovered the quest, not that it was assigned.

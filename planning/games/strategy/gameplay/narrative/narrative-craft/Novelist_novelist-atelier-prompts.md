⚠️ **IMPORTANT — READ BEFORE RUNNING:**

**Claude.ai users:** Attach your manuscript as a .txt, .docx, or .pdf file directly in this chat window, then send this prompt.

**API / Claude Code users:** Upload your manuscript as a .docx or .md file and reference it in your request. Ensure your context window is large enough (use claude-opus-4 or claude-sonnet-4 with extended context).

**⚠ TOKEN COST WARNING:** A full novel (80,000–120,000 words) will consume 300,000–600,000+ tokens per analysis run. This will incur **significant API costs** — potentially $15–$60+ per run depending on your plan and model. Run this on completed or near-complete drafts only. For works-in-progress, use the individual chapter prompts in the Developmental and Chapter Review categories instead.

# YOUR TASK

You are a team of world-class editors: a developmental editor, line editor, copy editor, sensitivity reader, and literary analyst. Perform a complete 22-pass editorial analysis of this manuscript and produce a **professional, beautifully formatted HTML report** as your final output.

**Produce the full report as a single self-contained HTML document** that the user can save as a PDF (File → Print → Save as PDF in their browser). The HTML must include:

- A professional cover page with title, date, and overall grade
- A full table of contents with anchor links
- All 22 analysis sections with detailed findings
- Visual elements: pacing heatmap table, tension arc chart (SVG), character arc timeline, subplot tracker, word frequency bars, and a final scorecard
- Professional typography using Google Fonts (Playfair Display + Inter)
- A clean two-column layout where appropriate
- Color-coded severity indicators (🔴 Critical / 🟡 Important / 🟢 Minor)
- Page-break CSS for clean PDF output

---

## ANALYSIS PASSES — Complete ALL of the following:

### PASS 1 — PLOT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
Evaluate the three-act structure: setup, confrontation, resolution. Identify the inciting incident (chapter/page), midpoint shift, all-is-lost moment (75% mark), climax, and resolution. Map hero's journey archetypes present and missing. **Rate structural integrity 1–10.** Cite specific chapter references for every issue.

### PASS 2 — PACING HEATMAP
Create a chapter-by-chapter pacing table: Chapter | Tension (1–10) | Pacing Rating (Too Fast/Fast/Good/Slow/Draggy) | Scene Types | Energy Level. Identify energy valleys, momentum problems, action-to-reflection imbalance. List top 10 pacing fixes ranked by impact.

### PASS 3 — CHARACTER ARC CONSISTENCY
For each major character: map their arc (start → turning points → end), identify growth evidence, flag regression moments, assess arc completion, check motivation consistency. Flag any character who changes too abruptly, doesn't change at all, or acts out of character for plot convenience.

### PASS 4 — THEMATIC COHERENCE
Identify the central theme beneath the plot. Assess how subplots reinforce or contrast the theme. Flag thematic drift. Map each character's journey to the theme. Evaluate the thematic resolution. Flag heavy-handed or preachy moments.

### PASS 5 — WORLD-BUILDING CONTINUITY SCAN
Check: setting contradictions (room layouts, geography, distances), rule violations (magic/tech/social), timeline errors (days/dates/seasons), character knowledge problems (knowing things they shouldn't), missing/disappeared characters, object tracking failures. Organize by severity: Critical / Important / Minor.

### PASS 6 — STAKES ESCALATION
Analyze personal stakes (what the protagonist loses), external stakes (widening consequences), urgency/ticking clock, cost of action increasing, point of no return, stakes at climax being the highest. Flag any moment where stakes plateau, decrease, or feel artificial.

### PASS 7 — SUBPLOT TRACKING
For each subplot: introduction chapter, purpose (serves main plot/theme how?), key beats, resolution quality, dropped threads. Flag redundant subplots, underdeveloped threads, and subplots that damage pacing.

### PASS 8 — DIALOGUE AUTHENTICITY
Rate each major character's voice uniqueness 1–10. Flag info-dumping ("As you know, Bob" moments). Identify best/worst subtext examples. Note unique speech patterns. Assess tag-vs-action-beat ratio. Flag emotionally inauthentic conversations. Suggest rewrites for the 10 worst dialogue passages.

### PASS 9 — SHOW VS. TELL AUDIT
Flag emotional telling, character description telling, backstory dumps, motivation telling, atmosphere telling. For the 10 worst offenders: quote original → write showing rewrite → explain why it's stronger. Note: flag only cases where showing would genuinely improve the experience.

### PASS 10 — SCENE TENSION & CONFLICT CHECK
For each scene: Goal (what does POV character want?) | Obstacle | Stakes | Outcome. Flag scenes where the character has no goal, there's no opposition, nothing changes, or tension is purely internal with no external manifestation. These are cut/strengthen candidates.

### PASS 11 — TRANSITION SMOOTHNESS
Check chapter endings (hook quality) and openings (orientation quality). Assess scene break clarity, POV shift handling, flashback/flash-forward mechanics, and tonal shift intentionality.

### PASS 12 — EMOTIONAL BEAT MAPPING
Chapter by chapter: dominant emotion, emotional high point, emotional low point, emotional variety. Assess: emotional monotone risk, whether big moments are properly set up, whether the emotional climax is the strongest moment, quiet intimate moments between action.

### PASS 13 — SENSORY DETAIL AUDIT
Sense inventory: which of the 5 senses are used/underused? Check for visual-heavy writing. Assess key scenes for sensory grounding. Evaluate setting atmosphere distinctiveness. Check character-filtered POV sensory details. Identify 10–15 scenes needing sensory enrichment with specific suggestions.

### PASS 14 — INFO-DUMP & EXPOSITION DETECTION
Flag: backstory dumps, world-building lectures, As-you-know-Bob dialogue, mirror descriptions, prologue front-loading. For each: quote passage, explain problem, suggest natural integration.

### PASS 15 — COPY EDIT PASS
Grammar errors, punctuation (especially dialogue), spelling, homophone errors, subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, comma splices, run-on sentences. List all errors with location and correction.

### PASS 16 — LINE EDIT PASS
Prose rhythm (sentence length variety, flow, musicality), word choice precision, verb strength (replace weak was/had/got), clarity (confusing sentences, ambiguous references), redundancy. Show 10 before/after improvement examples.

### PASS 17 — OVERUSED WORDS & PHRASES
Overused adverbs/weak verbs/filler words with estimated frequency. Crutch phrases. AI-sounding words (delve, tapestry, testament, visceral, nuanced, multifaceted, resonate, paradigm, myriad, beacon, realm). Repetitive sentence openers. Passive voice frequency (target <10%). Adverb density (target <5 per 1000 words).

### PASS 18 — CRUTCH WORD ELIMINATION
Flag every instance of: just, really, very, quite, actually, basically, literally, suddenly, felt/feeling, started to/began to, seemed/appeared, that (unnecessary), nodded/shrugged/sighed (overused). Provide prioritized cut list with estimated word savings.

### PASS 19 — SENSITIVITY READ
Cultural representation authenticity, stereotypes, language sensitivity (outdated/offensive terms), agency for marginalized characters, historical accuracy, unconscious bias patterns (who are the villains/heroes/victims). Flag for professional sensitivity reader review.

### PASS 20 — BETA READER PANEL (5 Perspectives)
**Reader 1 — The Casual Reader:** Gut reactions, boredom points, enjoyment rating 1–10
**Reader 2 — The Genre Expert:** Genre compliance, trope execution, market positioning, rating 1–10
**Reader 3 — The Harsh Critic:** Plot holes, weak motivations, clichés, the single biggest problem
**Reader 4 — The Target Reader:** Emotional journey, favorite scenes, recommendation, rating 1–10
**Reader 5 — The Superfan:** What made you keep reading? What almost made you stop? Would you pre-order the sequel?

### PASS 21 — PROSE QUALITY SCORING
Rate 1–10 across: Voice Distinctiveness | Sentence Variety | Imagery Quality | Dialogue Naturalism | Description Efficiency | Emotional Resonance | Tension Craft | World Integration

### PASS 22 — FINAL SYNTHESIS & ACTION PLAN
1. **Overall Grade:** A–F with full justification
2. **Top 5 Strengths:** What to keep and amplify
3. **Critical Fixes (10–20 items):** Must-do, ranked by priority, with chapter references
4. **Important Improvements (10–20 items):** Should-do items
5. **Polish Items (5–10 items):** Nice-to-have refinements
6. **Revision Roadmap:** Pass 1 order → Pass 2 order → Pass 3 order of operations
7. **Market Readiness Assessment:** Ready for beta readers / agent submission / self-publishing?
8. **Encouraging Close:** What makes this manuscript worth finishing

### Story Arc
**Description:** Analyze story arc structure and proportions.

```
You are a developmental editor. Analyze the following manuscript excerpt and evaluate the story arc.

Specifically assess:
- Whether the setup, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution are clearly defined and proportionate

You are a developmental editor specializing in pacing and tension. Analyze the following manuscript excerpt for how effectively the stakes escalate throughout the narrative.

Specifically assess:
- Whether each act raises the cost of failure for the protagonist (personally, professionally, relationally, or existentially)
- Whether the reader is made to feel the weight of those stakes through scene construction — not just told about them
- Any moments where stakes deflate prematurely or plateau for too long

- Whether the timing of subplot resolutions disrupts or enhances the main narrative's momentum

Return your feedback as:
1. A list of all identified subplots with a status (resolved / unresolved / abandoned)
2. A bulleted list of subplots that need attention, with specific reasoning
3. One concrete revision suggestion for the most problematic subplot

- Chekhov's Guns that are introduced but never fired (or fired without introduction)

Return your feedback as:
1. A numbered list of identified issues ranked by severity (critical / moderate / minor)
2. For each issue: what the contradiction is, where it occurs, and why it breaks internal logic
3. A brief note on any issues that may be intentional (unreliable narrator, mystery setup, etc.) that should be verified with the author

CHAPTER:
---
[PASTE CHAPTER HERE]

```

---

### Character Motivations
**Description:** Evaluate whether character motivations are clear, believable, and consistent.

```
You are a developmental editor specializing in character psychology. Analyze the following manuscript excerpt and evaluate whether character motivations are clear, believable, and consistent.

Specifically assess:
- Whether each major character's want (external goal) and need (internal wound or truth) are discernible
- Whether character decisions feel motivated by who they are — or merely by what the plot requires
- Any moments where a character acts in a way that contradicts their established psychology without sufficient justification

Return your feedback as:
1. A character-by-character breakdown of want vs. need as you understand them from the text
2. A bulleted list of moments where motivation feels unclear, forced, or contradictory
3. One concrete revision suggestion for the character whose motivations are least convincing

CHAPTER:
---
[PASTE CHAPTER HERE]
---
```

---

### Thematic Cohesion
**Description:** Analyze how effectively central themes are woven through the narrative.

```
You are a literary editor. Analyze the following manuscript excerpt and evaluate how effectively the central theme(s) are woven through the narrative.

Specifically assess:
- Whether the theme is embodied in action, image, and subtext — rather than stated outright through dialogue or narration
- Whether supporting characters, subplots, and settings serve as thematic mirrors or counterpoints to the protagonist's arc
- Any sections where the theme feels absent, heavy-handed, or contradicted without purpose

Return your feedback as:
1. A statement of what you believe the central theme(s) to be, based solely on the text
2. A bulleted list of the strongest and weakest moments of thematic integration
3. One concrete revision suggestion to deepen thematic resonance in the weakest area

CHAPTER:
---
[PASTE CHAPTER HERE]

### Scene Purpose
**Description:** Evaluate whether each scene earns its place in the story.

```
You are a story editor evaluating narrative efficiency. Analyze each scene in the following manuscript excerpt and assess whether it earns its place in the story.

For each scene, determine whether it accomplishes at least two of the following:
- Advances the plot (something changes as a result of this scene)
- Reveals character (we learn something new and meaningful about who someone is)
- Raises the stakes (the cost of failure increases or a new threat emerges)
- Establishes theme (a thematic idea is dramatized, not just stated)

Return your feedback as:
1. A scene-by-scene table: Scene | Primary Function | Secondary Function | Verdict (Keep / Cut / Merge / Rewrite)
2. A brief explanation for any scene marked Cut, Merge, or Rewrite
3. One concrete revision suggestion for the scene doing the least narrative work

CHAPTER:
---
[PASTE CHAPTER HERE]
---
```

---

### Scene Openings
**Description:** Analyze the opening lines of each scene.

```
You are a line editor and story analyst focused on reader engagement. Analyze the opening lines of each scene in the following manuscript excerpt.

Specifically assess whether each scene opening:
- Drops the reader into action, tension, or a compelling sensory moment (rather than orientation or weather)
- Establishes whose scene it is and what they want within the first few lines
- Creates an implicit question that pulls the reader forward

Return your feedback as:
1. A list of each scene opening with a one-line verdict (Strong / Weak / Needs Work) and a brief reason
2. Rewrite suggestions for the two weakest scene openings, preserving the author's voice
3. A pattern note — if the author has a recurring scene-opening weakness, name it specifically

CHAPTER:
---
[PASTE CHAPTER HERE]
---
```

---

### Scene Endings & Momentum
**Description:** Analyze the ending lines of each scene.

```
You are a story editor specializing in pacing and reader compulsion. Analyze the ending lines of each scene in the following manuscript excerpt.

Specifically assess whether each scene ending:
- Closes one question while opening another (the "yes, but / no, and" principle)
- Ends on a moment of change, revelation, decision, or unresolved tension — rather than a tidy wrap-up
- Creates forward momentum that makes stopping feel difficult

Return your feedback as:
1. A list of each scene ending with a one-line verdict (Propulsive / Flat / Closed Too Neatly) and a brief reason
2. Rewrite suggestions for the two flattest scene endings, preserving the author's voice
3. A pattern note — if the author tends toward a particular type of weak ending, name and explain it

CHAPTER:
---
[PASTE CHAPTER HERE]
---
```

---

### POV Consistency
**Description:** Analyze POV consistency within each scene.

```
You are a line editor. Analyze the following manuscript excerpt for POV consistency within each scene.

Specifically look for:
- Head-hopping (shifting between character consciousnesses within a single scene without a clear break)
- POV intrusions — moments where information, observations, or language couldn't plausibly belong to the POV character
- Distance inconsistency — unearned shifts from deep interiority to remote, cinematic narration within the same scene

Return your feedback as:
1. The identified POV mode (First Person / Third Limited / Third Omniscient / Second / Mixed) and whether it's applied consistently
2. A numbered list of specific POV violations with line references and explanation of the problem
3. One concrete revision suggestion for the most disorienting POV break

CHAPTER:
---
[PASTE CHAPTER HERE]
---
```

---

### Scene-Level Conflict
**Description:** Analyze each scene for the presence and quality of conflict.

```
You are a story editor evaluating dramatic tension. Analyze each scene in the following manuscript excerpt for the presence and quality of conflict.

Conflict can be:
- Interpersonal (character vs. character)
- Internal (character vs. self)
- Environmental (character vs. world, nature, system)
- Philosophical (character vs. idea or belief)

Specifically assess:
- Whether every scene contains at least one active form of conflict
- Whether the conflict in each scene connects to the scene's core dramatic question
- Any scenes that feel static — where characters talk, move, or exist without meaningful opposition

Return your feedback as:
1. A scene-by-scene conflict audit: Scene | Conflict Type | Strength (Strong / Present / Weak / Absent)
2. A bulleted list of scenes where conflict is weak or absent, with explanation
3. One concrete revision suggestion for the most conflict-deficient scene

CHAPTER:

### Chapter Purpose/Theme Identification
**Description:** Analyze core narrative purpose and thematic function within the larger story.

```
Analyze this chapter and identify its core narrative purpose and thematic function within the larger story. Determine what this chapter is designed to accomplish — whether it advances plot, deepens character, establishes atmosphere, raises stakes, or shifts tone. Identify any central themes present (e.g., betrayal, identity, sacrifice) and explain how the chapter embodies or develops them. Note whether the thematic intent is clearly executed or muddled by competing elements. Flag any moments where the chapter loses focus or drifts from its primary purpose.

### Key Events Summary
**Description:** Identify and summarize key events in order.

```
Identify and summarize the key events in this chapter in the order they occur. Focus only on events that carry narrative weight — those that change circumstances, shift relationships, reveal information, or create consequences. Distinguish between plot events (external action) and emotional/internal events (decisions, realizations, shifts in feeling). Flag any events that are underdeveloped, rushed, or given disproportionate page time relative to their importance. Note whether each key event connects logically and causally to what precedes and follows it. Identify any events that feel extraneous or could be cut without damaging the chapter's purpose.

### Character Growth Analysis
**Description:** Analyze character development and arc changes.

```
Analyze the character development that occurs in this chapter for each named character with a significant presence. For each character, identify where they begin emotionally, psychologically, or motivationally at the chapter's opening and where they end. Determine whether meaningful growth, regression, or revelation has occurred and whether it feels earned by the events on the page. Flag any character whose arc feels stagnant, contradictory, or inconsistent with their established traits. Note moments where a character's change feels forced, unearned, or conveniently timed. Identify missed opportunities where growth could have been more clearly dramatized or deepened.

### Backstory Revealed
**Description:** Identify and evaluate backstory delivery.

```
Identify all backstory introduced in this chapter — information about characters, world, history, or events that occurred before the chapter's present timeline. For each instance of backstory, evaluate whether it is delivered at the right moment (i.e., when the reader most needs or wants it), whether it is proportionate in length to its narrative importance, and whether it is integrated naturally into the scene or delivered artificially (e.g., forced flashbacks, unprompted explanation). Flag any backstory that halts narrative momentum, over-explains, or could be cut without consequence. Note any backstory the chapter withholds that the reader urgently needs for clarity or emotional investment.

### Character Interactions
**Description:** Analyze exchanges between characters.

```
Analyze every significant interaction between characters in this chapter. For each exchange — dialogue or physical — evaluate whether the interaction feels authentic to both characters' established voices and motivations. Determine what each character wants from the other in the scene and whether that tension is present and active on the page. Flag dialogue that feels expository, on-the-nose, or out of character. Identify subtext: note where what characters say diverges from what they mean or want, and evaluate whether that subtext is effectively written. Highlight any interactions that feel unresolved, underwritten, or that miss an opportunity to deepen relationship dynamics.

### Exposition Delivery
**Description:** Evaluate expository passages and delivery methods.

```
Identify all expository passages in this chapter — sections where the narrative pauses to deliver information about setting, world-building, character history, or context. For each, evaluate the delivery method (narration, dialogue, internal thought, environmental detail) and determine whether the method suits the scene's tone and pacing. Flag exposition that is front-loaded, excessive, repetitive, or delivered through unnatural dialogue ("as you know" constructions). Assess whether the reader is given enough information to remain oriented without being over-explained. Suggest where exposition could be compressed, cut, or redistributed into action and scene rather than summary.

### Information Clarity
**Description:** Evaluate clarity of information delivery.

```
Evaluate the clarity of information delivery throughout this chapter from the perspective of a reader experiencing it for the first time. Identify any passages where it is unclear who is speaking, who is in the scene, where the scene is taking place, or what is happening and why. Flag pronoun ambiguity, unclear scene transitions, confusing timelines, or moments where the narrative assumes knowledge the reader does not yet have. Note where information is repeated unnecessarily. Assess whether key plot points, character motivations, and cause-and-effect relationships are legible without being over-explained. Provide specific line-level examples where clarity breaks down.

### Information Relevance
**Description:** Assess relevance of information to story needs.

```
Evaluate every piece of information delivered in this chapter — plot details, character facts, world-building, backstory, and context — and assess its relevance to the story's present needs. For each significant block of information, determine whether it serves an immediate narrative purpose (advancing plot, deepening character, creating tension) or whether it is included out of the author's attachment rather than the reader's need. Flag information that is redundant, premature, or so tangential that it dilutes focus. Identify any details that are introduced but never paid off, and any critical information the chapter fails to deliver when the narrative demands it. Distinguish between information that enriches and information that merely fills space.

### New Character Introduction
**Description:** Evaluate effectiveness of new character introductions.

```
Identify every new character introduced in this chapter and evaluate the effectiveness of each introduction. For each character, assess whether the reader is given enough immediate information to distinguish them — voice, physical presence, attitude, role — without being overwhelmed by detail. Determine whether the character's introduction is motivated by the scene (they appear because the story requires them) or feels forced or convenient. Evaluate whether the character makes a distinct impression on first appearance and whether their purpose in the narrative is at least partially legible. Flag introductions that are too sparse to be memorable, too dense to be digestible, or that drop a character into the scene without sufficient grounding. Note whether any new character risks being confused with an existing one.

### Setting & World-Building
**Description:** Analyze setting and world-building passages.

```
Analyze how setting and world-building are handled in this chapter. Identify every passage where the physical environment, time period, social context, or world rules are established or developed. Evaluate whether setting is rendered through specific, sensory detail or delivered as vague generality. Assess whether the world-building is integrated into the action and character experience or front-loaded as passive description. Determine whether the setting actively influences the scene — affecting character behavior, mood, and conflict — or functions as inert backdrop. Flag any world-building that halts pacing, over-explains rules or history, or assumes the reader shares context the text has not yet established. Note any setting details that feel inconsistent with what has been previously established in the story.

### Tropes Identification
**Description:** Identify recognizable narrative tropes.

```
Identify all recognizable narrative tropes present in this chapter — character archetypes, plot devices, relationship dynamics, dialogue patterns, and situational conventions drawn from genre tradition or broader storytelling culture. For each trope identified, name it clearly, cite the specific passage or element where it appears, and assess how consciously it appears to be employed. Distinguish between tropes that are used with intention and craft versus those that appear to have slipped in as defaults. Evaluate whether each trope serves the story's specific needs or whether it substitutes for original character, plot, or emotional work. Note any tropes that risk undermining reader trust or creating predictability that works against narrative tension.

```

### Trope Subversion
**Description:** Analyze deliberate trope inversions and subversions.

```
Analyze this chapter for instances where familiar tropes, conventions, or reader expectations are deliberately subverted, inverted, or complicated. For each subversion identified, evaluate whether it is executed with sufficient clarity — that is, whether the reader can recognize the expectation being undermined in order to feel the impact of its departure. Assess whether the subversion serves a meaningful narrative or thematic purpose or whether it functions only as a surface-level surprise. Flag subversions that are undermined by inconsistent execution, that rely on the reader having knowledge the text hasn't established, or that inadvertently introduce new clichés in place of the ones being avoided. Identify any moments where a trope could have been subverted more effectively but was instead played straight without apparent intention.

### Line Edit for Clarity & Flow
**Description:** Sharpen prose without changing the author's voice.

```
You are a line editor. Cardinal rule: never sacrifice the author's voice for clarity.

Target:
- Sentences that are tangled or require re-reading
- Abrupt or muddy transitions
- Passive constructions that drain energy (flag — don't blindly fix)
- Vague, abstract language where concrete detail would land harder
- Filler phrases: "it was," "there were," "began to"
- Overwritten moments that undercut their own emotional impact

Present as: Original → Suggested Revision + one-line note on why. Always note if original is a valid style choice.

### Show vs. Tell Audit
**Description:** Find telling that should be showing, and vice versa.

```
You are a line editor. Audit this text for show vs. tell balance.

TELLING TO FLAG (needs showing): Abstract emotional statements, character trait announcements, summarized reactions that could be dramatized.

SHOWING TO FLAG (could be told): Scenes over-dramatized when a quick summary would serve better. Not all telling is bad — flag only where it actively weakens impact.

For each flag: Quote → label (NEEDS SHOWING or OVER-SHOWN) → rewritten example.

End with: The ratio feels [too much telling / balanced / too much showing] because ___

### Sensory Depth Pass
**Description:** Identify where sensory detail is missing or underdeveloped.

```
You are a line editor. Do a sensory depth pass on this text.

Map which senses are active in each scene: sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, proprioception, temperature.

For each scene or section:
- List which senses are present
- Flag which are absent or underused where they'd deepen immersion
- Identify passages that feel visually over-loaded
- Suggest 2–3 specific sensory additions (concrete, not generic) that would most elevate the scene

### Sentence Variety & Rhythm
**Description:** Analyze sentence variety and rhythmic quality.

```
You are a prose stylist and line editor. Analyze the following manuscript excerpt for sentence variety and rhythmic quality.

Specifically assess:
- Whether the author varies sentence length meaningfully — using short sentences for impact and longer sentences for momentum, immersion, or complexity
- Whether syntactic patterns repeat in ways that create monotony (e.g., subject-verb-object dominance, constant participial openers)
- Whether the prose rhythm matches the emotional register of the scene (terse in action, expansive in reflection, staccato in panic)

Return your feedback as:
1. A prose rhythm profile — describe the author's dominant patterns in plain language
2. Two or three representative passages that illustrate both strengths and weaknesses
3. Specific revision suggestions for the most rhythmically flat or monotonous passage, with a rewritten example

### Word Choice Precision
**Description:** Analyze precision and intentionality of word choice.

```
You are a line editor with a focus on diction and specificity. Analyze the following manuscript excerpt for the precision and intentionality of word choice.

Specifically look for:
- Vague, generic, or overused words that could be replaced with more precise, evocative alternatives (e.g., "walked" vs. "shuffled," "nice" vs. a specific quality)
- Adverb and adjective overuse that signals weak verb/noun choices
- Tonal inconsistencies where word choice doesn't match the scene's emotional register or the POV character's voice
- Clichés, dead metaphors, or mixed metaphors

Return your feedback as:
1. A list of the ten most problematic word choices or phrases, each with a suggested alternative and a brief reason
2. A note on whether the author's diction is generally precise, imprecise, or inconsistent — and what drives the pattern
3. One passage rewritten with improved word choice precision as a model for revision

### Dialogue Naturalism
**Description:** Analyze dialogue for naturalism, distinctiveness, and dramatic function.

```
You are a dialogue editor and script consultant. Analyze the dialogue in the following manuscript excerpt for naturalism, distinctiveness, and dramatic function.

Specifically assess:
- Whether each character has a distinct voice — vocabulary, rhythm, deflection patterns, and verbal habits that belong only to them
- Whether dialogue sounds like how people actually speak (with interruption, subtext, indirection, and evasion) rather than how they conveniently explain things
- Whether dialogue is doing double or triple duty (revealing character AND advancing plot AND suggesting subtext) or merely conveying information
- Overuse of dialogue tags beyond "said," on-the-nose exposition delivered through speech, or characters who speak in complete grammatical paragraphs

Return your feedback as:
1. A character-by-character voice assessment — is each speaker distinguishable without dialogue tags?
2. A bulleted list of specific dialogue exchanges that are too on-the-nose, expository, or unnatural, with brief notes
3. One dialogue passage rewritten to demonstrate stronger subtext and voice distinction

## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Evaluate the chapter across these six dimensions and score each 1–10 (10 = strongly AI-generated):

---

### 1. LINGUISTIC FINGERPRINTS
Flag any of the following AI-characteristic phrases and constructions:

**Transition overuse:**
- "It's worth noting that…" / "It is important to note…"
- "Furthermore," / "Moreover," / "Additionally," / "In addition,"
- "It goes without saying…" / "Needless to say…"
- "As previously mentioned…" / "As noted above…"
- "In conclusion," / "To summarize," / "In summary,"
- "This is not to say…" / "That said," / "With that in mind,"

**Hedging & qualification clusters:**
- "It's important to remember that…"
- "Of course, this is not always the case…"
- "While there are many factors to consider…"
- "The answer, of course, is complex…"
- "There is no one-size-fits-all answer…"
- "It depends on a variety of factors…"

**Hollow affirmations:**
- "Absolutely!" / "Certainly!" / "Of course!" / "Great question!"
- "You raise an excellent point…"
- "This is a fascinating topic…"

**Filler constructions:**
- "At the end of the day…"
- "In the grand scheme of things…"
- "It's a double-edged sword…"
- "All things considered…"
- "In today's [world/society/landscape]…"
- "Throughout history, humans have…"

**Score (1–10):** ___
**Evidence found:** [list specific examples with line references]

---

### 2. VOCABULARY PATTERNS
Flag repeated use of AI-favored words and terms:

**Overused descriptors:**
delve, dive into, explore, unpack, navigate, foster, leverage, utilize, facilitate,
tapestry, mosaic, kaleidoscope, labyrinth, nuanced, multifaceted, robust, holistic,
comprehensive, pivotal, crucial, paramount, essential, fundamental, intricate,
vibrant, dynamic, transformative, groundbreaking, revolutionary, game-changing,
profound, significant, notable, remarkable, unprecedented

**Abstract noun clusters:**
synergy, paradigm, framework, ecosystem, landscape, journey, intersection,
intersection of [X] and [Y], the realm of, the world of, the fabric of

**Verb inflation:**
"showcases" instead of "shows"
"demonstrates" instead of "proves"
"highlights" instead of "points to"
"underscores" instead of "confirms"
"encompasses" instead of "includes"

**Score (1–10):** ___
**Evidence found:** [list specific examples]

---

### 3. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS
Look for these AI-characteristic organizational habits:

- **The Rule-of-Three Obsession:** Ideas consistently grouped in threes; lists of exactly three examples
- **Symmetric Paragraph Architecture:** Every paragraph begins with a topic sentence, develops with two supporting points, and ends with a wrap-up
- **The Balanced Caveat:** Each positive claim immediately followed by an equal-length counterpoint
- **Section Bookending:** Chapters open and close with near-identical language or themes
- **Exhaustive Enumeration:** Tendency to list "not just A, but also B, C, and D" when A would suffice
- **Rhetorical Question Reliance:** Using questions ("But what does this mean?") to manufacture forward momentum
- **Artificial Escalation:** Moving from "small" to "global" scale at the end of paragraphs or sections

**Score (1–10):** ___
**Structural issues identified:** [describe]

---

### 4. VOICE & AUTHENTICITY MARKERS
Human writing typically includes:
- Idiosyncratic word choices that aren't "optimal"
- Incomplete thoughts or tangents that reveal a thinking mind
- Contradictions or genuine uncertainty (not performed uncertainty)
- Sensory specificity that feels lived-in, not researched
- Humor or irony that takes genuine risks
- An opinion the author seems to actually hold, with weight behind it
- **Asymmetry Detection:** When a single detail has unusually clean comic timing inside otherwise rougher prose, that asymmetry is worth flagging even if the detail itself passes surface inspection. Smoothness is still a signal.

AI writing typically includes:
- Consistent emotional temperature (never too hot, never too cold)
- "Safe" opinions that acknowledge all sides before landing on nothing
- Wisdom that sounds good but is empty on reflection ("The journey is just as important as the destination")
- Absence of authorial personality or a personality that reads as performed
- Information presented without surprise or confusion — as though the author never discovered it

**Score (1–10):** ___
**Voice assessment:** [describe what the author's voice feels like — or fails to feel like]

---

### 5. KNOWLEDGE TEXTURE
Examine how knowledge is handled:

- **Sourcing:** Does the author cite specific, verifiable sources or lean on vague authority ("studies show," "experts agree," "research suggests")?
- **Specificity:** Are examples concrete and traceable, or generic and illustrative?
- **Surprising Facts:** Does the chapter contain information that feels genuinely unexpected, or does it confirm what you already assumed?
- **Gaps:** Are there obvious follow-up questions the author ignores that a real expert would have addressed?

**Score (1–10):** ___
**Knowledge texture notes:** [describe]

---

### 6. CONSISTENCY & COHERENCE ANOMALIES
Check for:
- Contradictions between sections that suggest stitched-together outputs
- Sudden shifts in register (formal to casual, technical to accessible) without motivation
- Ideas referenced as "discussed earlier" that weren't actually discussed
- Character or subject descriptions that reset between sections
- Overlong scene-setting before any content is delivered
- Tonal flatness: no paragraph is significantly more energetic or urgent than any other

**Score (1–10):** ___
**Anomalies found:** [describe]

---

## VERDICT

**Total Score:** ___ / 60

| Range | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 6–18 | Likely human-written — minor AI-style tendencies at most |
| 19–30 | Ambiguous — may be AI-assisted or human writing with AI habits |
| 31–44 | Probably AI-generated or heavily AI-edited |
| 45–60 | Almost certainly AI-generated |

**Summary judgment:** [2–4 sentences: overall assessment, strongest signals, confidence level]

**Most suspicious passages:** [quote 2–3 specific excerpts with brief explanation of why they read as AI]

**Recommendations:** [If ambiguous, what additional information or comparison material would help confirm?]

### Closing Line Workshop
**Description:** Craft a chapter-ending line with maximum resonance.

```
You are a prose stylist specializing in chapter endings.

WHAT HAPPENED: [SUMMARIZE WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CHAPTER]
WHAT'S COMING: [BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHAT COMES NEXT]
CURRENT CLOSING: [YOUR CURRENT CLOSING LINE, OR: None yet]

Generate 6 closing line options:
1. The gut-punch — an image or fact that lands like a blow
2. The quiet devastation — understated, the weight arrives after
3. The question — leaves the reader unable to stop thinking
4. The reframe — changes how the reader sees everything before it
5. The echo — callbacks a word or image from the chapter's opening
6. The door — ends mid-motion, pure momentum into the next chapter

For each: what emotion it leaves behind.
Then: My recommendation for this chapter's emotional needs is ___ because ___.

## 10. Chapter-Level Review

---

### Overused Phrases & Words
**Description:** Find repetitive or clichéd language and suggest alternatives.

```
You are a prose editor specializing in eliminating overused, repetitive, and clichéd language.

NOVEL CONTEXT: [BRIEF CONTEXT / CHARACTER NAMES / SETTING NOTES]

Scan the following chapter for:
1. **Repeated words** — Words used too frequently (especially adjectives, adverbs, verbs)
2. **Clichés** — Overused phrases and expressions
3. **Filter words** — "He saw", "She heard", "He felt", "She noticed" etc.
4. **Weak constructions** — "There was", "It was", "He was", "She had"
5. **Redundancies** — Words or phrases that say the same thing twice
6. **Said-isms** — Overuse of "said" or weak dialogue tags
7. **Telling instead of Showing** — Instances where showing would be stronger

For each issue found, provide:
- The problematic phrase (quoted exactly)
- The line number or location
- Why it's problematic
- A suggested replacement (or "cut" if it can be removed)

Finally, provide a revised version of the first 500 words with your corrections applied.

### Pronoun Usage Analysis
**Description:** Check pronoun density and sentence-start pronouns.

```
You are a prose editor specializing in varied, strong sentence construction.

Analyze the following chapter for pronoun usage patterns. The goal is to keep total pronoun usage under 15% and sentences starting with pronouns under 30%.

TARGETS:
- Total pronoun usage: under 15% of all words
- Sentence-start pronouns: under 30% of all sentences

Calculate and report:
1. **Total word count** and **total pronoun count**
2. **Pronoun density percentage** (pronouns ÷ total words × 100)
3. **Total sentences** and **sentences starting with pronouns**
4. **Initial pronoun percentage** (sentence-start pronouns ÷ total sentences × 100)

For each category, note if it passes or fails the target.

If OVER the targets, identify the specific problem sentences and provide revised versions with:
- Stronger sentence openers (action verbs, sensory details, setting, subject presence)
- Name substitutions where appropriate
- Varied sentence structures

Also identify any sentences that could be combined or restructured for better flow.

## 11. Paragraph-Level

### Paragraph Dissection
**Description:** Sentence-level analysis and improvement of a single paragraph.

You are a line editor. Dissect this paragraph at the sentence level.

- If Weak: explain why and provide a rewrite

Assess the paragraph as a whole:
- Does it have a clear through-line?
- Is the rhythm varied and intentional?
- Does it earn its length?
- What is the single most impactful change?

Finally: Provide a polished rewrite incorporating your best suggestions (keep the author's voice).

### Transition Repair
**Description:** Fix a jarring or unclear transition between paragraphs or scenes.

```
You are a line editor specializing in flow and transitions. The transition between these sections isn't working. Diagnose and offer solutions.

Diagnose:

- Is this a tonal shift, a time jump, a POV distance change, a pace change?
- What's currently bridging them (if anything)?
- Why isn't it working?

Then provide 3 different transition options:
1. A bridging sentence or short paragraph
2. A structural fix (scene break, section break, different ending)
3. A rewrite of one or both endings/openings to create natural flow

CONTEXT: [PASTE 1-2 SURROUNDING SENTENCES FOR CONTEXT]
KNOWN ISSUE: [DESCRIBE WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT, OR WRITE: Diagnose yourself]

VERSION 1 — Tighter: Cut every unnecessary word. Minimum viable sentence.
VERSION 2 — Punchier rhythm: Reorder for a stronger landing. End on the word with most weight.
VERSION 3 — More concrete: Replace abstractions or vague verbs with specific, physical language.
VERSION 4 — More voice: Push the character or narrator's voice harder. Make it more "theirs."
VERSION 5 — Syntactic experiment: Try a completely different sentence structure (fragment, inversion, list, etc.)

For each: one phrase explaining what changed and why it works.
```

---

### Verb Audit
**Description:** Replace weak or passive verbs with muscular, specific alternatives.

```
You are a line editor. Do a verb audit on this text.

Flag every instance of:
- "To be" constructions that could be cut or made active
- Vague motion verbs: went, came, moved, got — replace with specific action
- "Began to" / "started to" constructions — usually just cut them
- Passive voice (flag it, don't automatically fix — sometimes it's right)
- Verbs propped up by adverbs — find one strong verb instead

For each flag: Original → Suggested Verb(s) → one-word reason.
Then: A rewritten version of the 3 weakest sentences with upgraded verbs.
